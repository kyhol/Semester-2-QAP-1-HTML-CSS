1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

2. What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of Making this all! from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

Answers:

1. That's a good question. I used the project to curb my depressive episode, so anywhere from 10-25 hours lol. I lost myself in it. Learned a lot.

2. w3schools, youtube, oreillys, developer.mozilla.org, ChatGPT, Copilot. I'm sure there's more, but I don't remember. 

3. I think I asked Bradley Ayers if he used "|" to separate a section, so I used that. I think that's the only question I asked anyone.

4. Nope. 

5. I think the difficulty scales on how much time you intend to put into it. As I get addicted to coding when I start, I would put it at a 8? I did so much research etc. It was incredibly tedious, which pushed it from a 7 to an 8. 

Have a nice day :)
